# Interactive Plane Sweep Algorithm for line segments (Pedagogical Aid)


## Team Members
* Casey Meisenzahl

## Project Description
Web based application. The Plane Sweep Algorithm has an intuitive name but it can be a little tricky to know exactly what is happening at each step. The interactive tool will allow you to move the sweeping line over a set of line segments. Progressing the algorithm or reverting the algorithm to the prior step. Adjacent to the line segments / sweeping line there will be another visualization of the data structure. The data structure will have corresponding highlights showing what actions are causing the reordering of the data structure.
