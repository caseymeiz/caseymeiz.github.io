## Experience 
### Oracle, Co op Applications Engineer
Works within the Construction Engineering Busissnes Unit.

### Town of Brighton, Engineering Intern
Developed a payroll processing subsystem. Which included a GUI and reporting tool to complement an activity tracker. The application was written in Java which calculates wages of over 40 employees and generates pdf reports.

Created a script to perform analysis of sewer systems to determine when pipes should be replaced based on their age and expected lifespans of the material used (over 3,500 pipes analyzed). This information is displayed graphically on ArcMap. This allowed executives to easily determine at risk sewer sections geographically within the Town of Brighton.

Worked with SQL databases, file systems, and geocoding APIs to automate the unification of multiple data sources into geodatabases to be consumed on ArcMap. This allowed employees to access spatially relevant information in one place.
